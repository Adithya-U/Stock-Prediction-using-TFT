Predicting stock price movements is a complex task influenced by a range of factors, including historical trends, financial news, and domain-specific knowledge. Traditional models often struggle to incorporate unstructured data like textual news or external knowledge representations. This project presents a multi-modal forecasting framework that integrates historical stock prices with news-based context using a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). News articles related to the target stock are encoded using a Sentence Transformer, producing 198-dimensional sentence embeddings. These embeddings are then reduced to five principal components using PCA, preserving the most informative features. The reduced vectors are aligned temporally with historical stock data and fed into the TFT. By combining structured time-series data with compressed semantic representations of financial news, the model aims to improve prediction accuracy, offer interpretable outputs, and support informed decision-making in financial forecasting.
